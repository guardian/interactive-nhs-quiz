    <div class="notes">Question 6 was amended on 18 January as the earlier version was unclear. Generally, Nice considers that interventions costing the NHS less than £20,000 for each full quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained are cost effective; however, treatments costing between £20,000 and £30,000 per year gained may also be deemed cost effective if certain conditions are satisfied. A higher limit of £50,000 per QALY is allowed in the case of end-of-life treatments.</div>
